### Rainbow Weighted Average

Rainbow-Weighted Averagin (RWA) is a variation of the traditional Dollar Cost Average (DCA) method of investing that takes into account the current Rainbox Index. The idea comes from [this post in Reddit by the user u/pseudoHappyHippy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qg9s6v/introducing_rainbowweighted_averaging_a_more/). The author claims that RWA outperforms DCA 96.8% of the time by an average of 35.3% greater returns when applied to historical BTC price data

### Fear and Greed Index

The Fear and Greed Index is a tool that helps investors and traders analyze the Bitcoin and Crypto market from a sentiment perspective. It identifies the extent to which the market is becoming overly fearful or overly greedy. Hence why it is called the Fear and Greed Index.
